Description:
    The SAND format is a means of coupling tables of data with their column
    descriptions in a way that is both human and machine readable.  R has
    powerful tools for packaging and describing data, but sharing data as Rdata
    objects is not very useful for non-R users. The sandr package includes
    functions for validating, loading, and cleaning SAND data as well as
    methods for translating between R data and SAND.
